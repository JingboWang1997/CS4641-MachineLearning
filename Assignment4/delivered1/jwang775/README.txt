GTID: jwang775

Modification based on BURLAP library and an existing extension of the BURLAP library:
- Designed and created my own MDPs

Code:
- The code for this assignment is in the directory “jwang775/assignment4”
- pom.xml for the project build
- “jwang775/assignment4/src/main/java/edu/gatech/cs4641/assignment4/Main.java” contains the main method entry point for this project

Instructions for running:
(IntelliJ is installed, Eclipse should work as well, but intelliJ preferred)
- select ‘Open’ in the initial intelliJ window
- open the project (“jwang775/assignment4” or “pom.xml”) with intelliJ
- if prompted, select ‘Open as Project’
- In the Main.java file
 - modify the PROBLEM variable to run the (1)small MDP or the (2)large MDP
 - modify the algorithm variable to run different algorithms
 - modify parameters within lines 136-190 to run algorithms with different parameters
 - the bottom of the file contains the creation of the two MDPs
- After modifying the parameters, run the main function to run any one algorithm on any one of the two MDPs
- There should be experiment data printed in the terminal
